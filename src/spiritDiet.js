        introduction: `Everything Jesus Christ did, He did them to show us the detailed information about the way to greatness. Jesus Christ prepared for 30 years to do ministry for 3 years of which we have not yet exhausted.`,
        points:`Don't run away from your period of preparation, it's not always going to be easy. If you run, you are running far away from your greatness. Your destination will determine your preparation. As a believer in preparation, you will be insulted inside the journey. 

        A believer has to be prepared in his heart. If a believer is defeated in his heart, he will surely be defeated physically. Ezra7:10; Dan1:8. 
        
        No believer can be greater than his preparation so don't despise your place of preparation. The same way God prepares us, the devil also prepares us. It's up to believers to be sensitive enough to reject the devil's preparation. Each time a believer turns his back to his preparation (by God), he falls into the waiting hands of the devil.
        
        We must give our heart to the Lord in order to be able to navigate through our period of preparation successfully. God showed Joshua the ways of preparation for good success in his journey. Joshua 1:5-8
        
        As a prepared believer you must decrease so that God must increase. Everything good does not come easily so you must be stronger than your adversary or adversity. 1Peter5:8-10. Don't pity yourself when you are preparing for your greatness. Leave the pity for God. Psalm 103:13.`, 
        conclusion:`A Prepared Believer attracts God's blessings. `

        text: "John4:22; 2Cor4:9-10 ",
        introduction: `When you do not know the God you are serving, you tend to serve him any anyhow. Having Christ's consciousness is more than calling His name. It's all about being connected to christ at all times.`,
        points:`The consciousness of Christ we carry about will lead us at every point in our lives. 1Peter4:11; Col4:6; Gal1:11-12; Gal4:17-19. Christ must be at the centre of our purpose as a believer. Everything about your life should revolve around Christ when you are Christ conscious. Christ has to be formed in you for you to be transformed. 2Peter3:18; John1:12,16

        All things were created by Him and for Him. If we walk in Christ's consciousness, we will realize all things are created by Him and most importantly for Him. Col1:14-17. You are incomplete until you are filled with Christ's consciousness. Col2:9-10; Matt8:16-17.
        
        Nothing else matters to you except the personality of Christ when you are Christ conscious. The reason believers fall into sin over and over again is because they lack the consciousness of Christ. Heb6:3-6
        
        The consciousness of Christ will make you meditate on the scriptures. While you are meditating on the scriptures you are hearing, reading and seeing it. 
        2Cor6:17-18
        
        It will be very difficult for the devil to catch a believer who has the consciousness of Christ. When you are Christ conscious, you think more about what you can do for God and not what God can do for you.`, 
        conclusion:`Our character as believers must be christ centred. `}
